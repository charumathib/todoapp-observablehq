# todoapp-observablehq
This todo app was [built in ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/@charumathi-badrinath/d3-redux-and-redux-undo-todo-list) based on [this project](https://observablehq.com/@alejandrokennedy/d3-redux-and-redux-undo-todo-list) and embedded into HTML as an ```iframe``` that is now [hosted on Github Pages]( https://charumathib.github.io/todoapp-observablehq/). To enter a todo, simply type it into the text input box and click enter. Todos can be filtered by their status (active or completed).
